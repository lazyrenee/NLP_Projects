- [Hidden Markov Model Tagger](/HMM-Tagger)          
    Use the Pomegranate library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging with a universal tagset. Hidden Markov models have been able to achieve >96% tag accuracy with larger tagsets on realistic text corpora. 

- [Topic Modeling](/Topic%20Modeling)        
    Using LDA to classify text in a document to a particular topic category. It builds a topic per document model and words per topic model, modeled as Dirichlet distributions.This project uses a list of over one million news headlines published over 15 years.

- [Spam Classifier](/Spam-classifier)           
    Using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify dataset SMS messages(spam or non-spam) as a binary classification problem. Also, this is a supervised learning problem, as we will be feeding a labelled dataset into the model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions.

- [Attention Basics](/Attention_Basics)
    This is focus on implementing attention in isolation from a larger model and will implement attention scoring as well as calculating an attention context vector.. That's because when implementing attention in a real-world model, a lot of the focus goes into piping the data and juggling the various vectors rather than the concepts of attention themselves.

-[Deciphering Code with Character-Level RNN](/RNN_Keras_Lab)
    The dataset consists of 10,000 encrypted phrases and the plaintext version of each encrypted phrase. This project is to build a recurrent neural network and train it to decipher strings encrypted with a certain cipher. This project uses the techniques of preprocessing and model-building that will come in handy when start building more advanced models for machine translation, text summarization, and beyond.

-[RNN Sentiment Analysis](rnn_sentiment_analysis.ipynb)
    Use Recurrent Neural Networks to solve sentiment analysis for IMDb movie reviews, and in particular LSTMs, to perform sentiment analysis in Keras. The dataset is from Keras' built-in IMDb movie reviews dataset.
